Learing Typescript
Tasks
0.Create an interface for astudent
Copy the following configuration files (provided above) into the task_0 directory: package.json, .eslintrc.js, tsconfig.json, webpack.config.js

Write your code in the main.ts file:

Write an interface named Student that accepts the following elements: firstName(string), lastName(string), age(number), and location(string)
Create two students, and create an array named studentsList containing the two variables
Using Vanilla Javascript, render a table and for each elements in the array, append a new row to the table
Each row should contain the first name of the student and the location
Requirements:

When running, Webpack should return No type errors found.
Every variable should use TypeScript when possible.

2.Extending class teacher
Write an interface named Directors that extends Teacher. It requires an attribute named numberOfReports(number)

Example:

const director1: Directors = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  location: 'London',
  fullTimeEmployee: true,
  numberOfReports: 17,
};
console.log(director1);

// should print
// Object
// firstName: "John"
// fullTimeEmployee: true
// lastName: "Doe"
// location: "London"
// numberOfReports: 17

3. Printing Teachers
Write a function printTeacher:

It accepts two arguments firstName and lastName
It returns the first letter of the firstName and the full lastName
Example: printTeacher("John", "Doe") -> J. Doe
Write an interface for the function named printTeacherFunction.

4.Writing  a Class
Write a Class named StudentClass:

The constructor accepts firstName(string) and lastName(string) arguments
The class has a method named workOnHomework that return the string Currently working
The class has a method named displayName. It returns the firstName of the student
The constructor of the class should be described through an Interface
The class should be described through an Interface
Requirements:

You can reuse the Webpack configuration from the previous exercise to compile the code.
When running npm run build, no TypeScript error should be displayed.
Every variable should use TypeScript when possible.

5. Advance Types part 1
Create the DirectorInterface interface with the 3 expected methods:

workFromHome() returning a string
getCoffeeBreak() returning a string
workDirectorTasks() returning a string
Create the TeacherInterface interface with the 3 expected methods:

workFromHome() returning a string
getCoffeeBreak() returning a string
workTeacherTasks() returning a string
Create a class Director that will implement DirectorInterface

workFromHome should return the string Working from home
getToWork should return the string Getting a coffee break
workDirectorTasks should return the string Getting to director tasks
Create a class Teacher that will implement TeacherInterface

workFromHome should return the string Cannot work from home
getCoffeeBreak should return the string Cannot have a break
workTeacherTasks should return the string Getting to work
Create a function createEmployee with the following requirements:

It can return either a Director or a Teacher instance
It accepts 1 arguments:
salary(either number or string)
if salary is a number and less than 500 - It should return a new Teacher. Otherwise it should return a Director
Expected result:

console.log(createEmployee(200));
Teacher
console.log(createEmployee(1000));
Director
console.log(createEmployee('$500'));
Director

6. Creating functions specific to employees
Write a function isDirector:

it accepts employee as an argument
it will be used as a type predicate and if the employee is a director
Write a function executeWork:

it accepts employee as an argument
if the employee is a Director, it will call workDirectorTasks
if the employee is a Teacher, it will call workTeacherTasks
Expected result:

executeWork(createEmployee(200));
Getting to work
executeWork(createEmployee(1000));
Getting to director tasks

7. String Literals
Write a String literal type named Subjects allowing a variable to have the value Math or History only. Write a function named teachClass:

it takes todayClass as an argument
it will return the string Teaching Math if todayClass is Math
it will return the string Teaching History if todayClass is History

8. Create a directory called task_3 and copy these configuration files into it: package.json, webpack.config.js, tsconfig.json.

The first part of will require that you build an interface and a type. Inside a file named interface.ts:

Create a type RowID and set it equal to number
Create an interface RowElement that contains these 3 fields:
firstName: string
lastName: string
age?: number
You are building the next part of the application architecture. The goal is to save the entities to a database. Because of time constraints, you can’t write a connector to the database, and you decided to download a library called crud.js. Copy this file into the task_3/js directory.

Here it is

export function insertRow(row) {
  console.log('Insert row', row);
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.floor(1000));
}

export function deleteRow(rowId) {
  console.log('Delete row id', rowId);
  return;
}

export function updateRow(rowId, row) {
  console.log(`Update row ${rowId}`, row);

  return rowId;
}
Write an ambient file within task_3/js, named crud.d.ts containing the type declarations for each crud function. At the top of the file import RowID and RowElement from interface.ts.

In main.ts

At the top of the file create a triple slash directive that includes all the dependencies from crud.d.ts
Import the rowID type and rowElement from interface.ts
Import everything from crud.js as CRUD
Create an object called row with the type RowElement with the fields set to these values:

firstName: Guillaume
lastName: Salva
Create a const variable named newRowID with the type RowID and assign the value the insertRow command.

Next, create a const variable named updatedRow with the type RowElement and update row with an age field set to 23

Finally, call the updateRow and deleteRow commands.

Expected result:

const obj = {firstName: "Guillaume", lastName: "Salva"};
CRUD.insertRow(obj)
// Insert row {firstName: "Guillaume", lastName: "Salva"}

const updatedRow: RowElement = { firstName: "Guillaume", lastName: "Salva", age: 23 };
CRUD.updateRow(newRowID, updatedRow);
// Update row 125 {firstName: "Guillaume", lastName: "Salva", age: 23}

CRUD.deleteRow(125);
// Delete row id 125
Requirements:

When running npm run build, no TypeScript error should be displayed.
Every variable should use TypeScript when possible.
The main file and the ambient file should both import the types defined in the interface file.
You can easily test your ambient file by looking at the intellisense of your IDE when using the 3rd party functions.
